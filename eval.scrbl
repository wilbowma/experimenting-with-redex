@title[#:tag "sec:eval"]{Reduction and Evaluation in Redex}
After specifying my language syntax, I define reduction, normalization, and
evaluation.
Once I define the reduction relation, Redex gives me a nondeterministic
interpreter.
Redex makes this extremely easy.
I can give the small-step reductions, and Redex will compute for me the
compatible closure automatically, giving me a normalization relation.
If I need a specific reduction strategy, I can define the evaluation contexts
manually and have Redex compute the context closure of a relation.
For data like numbers, I don't need to resort to inductive encoding; I can
easily escape into Racket to compute.

After defining a reduction relation, Redex can do the following for me:
@itemize[
@item{apply one step of a reduction relation}
@item{apply a reduction relation until a normal form}
@item{apply a reduction relation until some condition}
@item{compute closures of a reduction relation}
]

@section{Reduction TLDR}
In short, I define the small-step reductions using @racket[reduction-relation].
I usually define the full reduction using @racket[compatible-closure], which in
1 line of code extends the small-step relation to apply under any context.
When I need a specific reduction strategy, I manually define evaluation contexts
as syntax, as in the previous section, and use @racket[context-closure].
For querying Redex reduction relations, I use @racket[apply-reduction-relation]
to apply a reduction relation a single step, and
@racket[apply-reduction-relation*] to reduce an expression to the normal form of
the given reduction relation.
Since @racket[apply-reduction-relation*] is a Racket function, I usually define
metafunctions using @racket[define-metafunction] to easily call the reduction
and normalization relations from Redex.
For testing reduction relations, I use @racket[test-->], @racket[test-->>], and
@racket[test-->>∃].

There is one common pitfall I run into: full reduction for mutually defined
syntax.
If expressions and values are mutually defined, for example, then
@racket[compatible-closure] will not compute the correct relation.
In this case, we must manually give the mutually defined contexts for which we
@racket[context-closure] should compute the closure of a relation.
Thankfully, Redex exposes the function @rtech{compatible-closure-context} for
computing common contexts.
In most cases I encounter, Redex can easily compute the various mutual contexts
with a couple of calls to @rtech{compatible-closure-context}, and then give me
full reduction relation using @racket[context-closure].

@section{Small-step Reduction}
In Redex, reduction relations are defined using @racket[reduction-relation].
It requires a language identifier and a sequence of rewrite rules.
The form also supports @emph{a lot} of optional and additional features, most of
which I never use.
I will commonly use @racket[#:domain] and @racket[#:codomain] to catch bugs,
including some pitfalls mentioned in the last section.

Below, I define the small-step reduction for @tech{BoxyL}.

@examples[
#:eval boxy-evalor
(define ->
  (reduction-relation
   BoxyL
   #:domain e
   #:codomain e
   (--> ((λ (x : A) e_1) e_2) (substitute e_1 x e_2)
       "β→")
   (--> (car (cons e_1 e_2)) e_1
       "β×₁")
   (--> (cdr (cons e_1 e_2)) e_2
       "β×₂")
   (--> (+ v_1 v_2) ,(+ (term v_1) (term v_2))
       "plus")
   (--> (let ((box x) (box e_1)) e_2) (substitute e_2 x e_1)
       "β□")))]

Unlike @racket[define-language], @racket[reduction-relation] creates a
@emph{Racket} value.
This means we need to bind it to an identifier using Racket's @racket[define].
It also means we have to be in Racket-land when using the reduction relation.

To run the reduction, I use @racket[apply-reduction-relation] to take a single
step, and @racket[apply-reduction-relation*] to run all possible reductions.

@examples[
#:eval boxy-evalor
(apply-reduction-relation -> (term (car (cons 1 2))))
(apply-reduction-relation* -> (term (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2))))
]

Like @racket[redex-match], both of these return a set of results,
since Redex allows the reduction relation to be non-deterministic.

We can use @racket[apply-reduction-relation*] to stop when an arbitrary
condition holds of the term being reduced.
For example, we can stop when we try to reduce @redex{(+ 1 2)}.
@examples[
#:eval boxy-evalor
(apply-reduction-relation* -> (term (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2)))
  #:stop-when (lambda (term)
                (redex-match? BoxyL (+ 1 2) term)))
]

@section{Evaluation and Normalization}
To define full reduction, we can easily get the compatible closure of the
relation with respect to a nonterminal.
Redex will lift the small-step relation to apply any reduction anywhere in any
subexpression of the nonterminal.
It's one line of code.

@examples[
#:eval boxy-evalor
(define ->* (compatible-closure -> BoxyL e))
(apply-reduction-relation* -> (term (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2)))))
(apply-reduction-relation* ->* (term (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2)))))
]

This lifts @racket[->] to apply under any context generated from the nonterminal
@redex{e}.
Now we can easily compute normal form of a term.

To define the call-by-value left-to-right semantics, we can reuse the evaluation
contexts defined earlier, and ask Redex to compute the closure of the relation
with respect to that context via @racket[context-closure].

@examples[
#:eval boxy-evalor
(define ->cbv (context-closure -> BoxyEvalL E))
(apply-reduction-relation ->cbv (term (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2)))))
(apply-reduction-relation* ->cbv (term (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2)))))
]

When I have a deterministic semantics, I define metafunctions that let me use a
reduction relation under @racket[term].
This helps me easily use reduction relations in Redex-land rather than
Racket-land, and reduces boilerplate.

@examples[
#:eval boxy-evalor
(define-metafunction BoxyL
  boxy-eval : e -> v
  [(boxy-eval e)
   ,(car (apply-reduction-relation* ->cbv (term e)))])

(define-metafunction BoxyL
  normalize : e -> e
  [(normalize e)
   ,(car (apply-reduction-relation* ->* (term e)))])

(term (boxy-eval (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2)))))
(term (normalize (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2)))))
]

@section{Testing Reduction Relations}
Redex provides a handful of test functions for reduction relations.
I use @racket[test-->] to test single steps of reduction.
@examples[
#:eval boxy-evalor
(test--> -> (term (+ 1 2)) (term 3))
(test--> -> #:equiv alpha-equivalent?
         (term ((λ (x : Nat) (λ (y : Nat) y)) 1))
         (term (λ (z : Nat) z)))
(test-results)
]
This takes the name of the relation, followed by an optional equivalence
predicate, and two terms.
It checks that the first term steps in one step of the relation to the second.

I use @racket[test-->>] to test arbitrary number of steps of reduction, which
has essentially the same interface.
@examples[
#:eval boxy-evalor
(test-->> ->* #:equiv alpha-equivalent?
          (term (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2))))
          (term (λ (z : Nat) 3)))
(test-results)
]

I use @racket[test-->>∃] (or @racket[test-->>E]) to test that there exists a way
to reduce a term to another term.
@examples[
#:eval boxy-evalor
(test-->>∃ ->*
          (term (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2))))
          (term (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons 3 2)))))
(test-->>∃ #:steps 1 ->*
         (term (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2))))
         (term (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons 3 2)))))
(test-->>∃ #:steps 1 ->*
           (term (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2))))
           (term (λ (x : Nat) 3)))
(test-->>∃ #:steps 2 ->*
           (term (λ (x : Nat) (car (cons (+ 1 2) 2))))
           (lambda (x)
             (alpha-equivalent? x (term (λ (z : Nat) 3)))))
(test-results)
]
Unlike the other test functions, @racket[test-->>∃] does not take an
@racket[#:equiv] optional argument, and doesn't obey @racket[default-equiv].
Instead, the second term can be either a value or a predicate.
@margin-note{This may change soon because I'm about to file a pull request.}

@section{Caveat: Compatible Closure of Mutually Defined Relations}
The @racket[compatible-closure] functions doesn't work when we have expressions whose
syntax is mutually defined, since @racket[compatible-closure] requires a single
nonterminal.
Consider the call-by-push-value language definition given below.
In this language, values and expressions are mutually defined, and have explicit
injection terms between each.

@(define cbpv-eval (make-base-eval))
@examples[
#:eval cbpv-eval
(require redex/reduction-semantics)

(define-language cbpvL
  (e ::= (λ (x) e) (e v) (force v) (return v))
  (v ::= (thunk e) () x)
  (x ::= variable-not-otherwise-mentioned)

  #:binding-forms
  (λ (x) e #:refers-to x))

(define ->
  (reduction-relation
   cbpvL
   (--> (force (thunk e)) e
        "force")
   (--> ((λ (x) e) v) (substitute e x v)
        "β")))

(apply-reduction-relation* -> (term (force (thunk (return x)))))
]

Trying to use @racket[compatible-closure] here will not give us full reduction.
Worse, it won't result in an error; instead, it will compute unexpected results.
Some terms will compute properly, while others won't.

@examples[
#:eval cbpv-eval
(define wrong->* (compatible-closure -> cbpvL e))
(define wrong^->* (compatible-closure -> cbpvL v))
code:blank
(apply-reduction-relation* wrong->*
  (term (λ (x) (return (thunk (λ (x) (force (thunk (return x)))))))))
(apply-reduction-relation* wrong^->*
  (term (λ (x) (return (thunk (λ (x) (force (thunk (return x)))))))))
code:blank
(apply-reduction-relation* wrong->*
  (term (thunk (λ (x) (return (thunk (λ (x) (force (thunk (return x))))))))))
(apply-reduction-relation* wrong^->*
  (term (thunk (λ (x) (return (thunk (λ (x) (force (thunk (return x))))))))))
]

The problem is that @racket[compatible-closure] is automatically computing a
context.
However, its default mode of computing the context does not work for mutually
defined nonterminals.

To properly define the full reduction relation for this language, we need to use
@racket[context-closure] and manually give the mutually defined contexts
All @racket[compatible-closure] does is compute the obvious context of a given
nonterminal and call @racket[context-closure].

We can define the contexts manually, but this is extremely tedious.
Thankfully, Redex exposes some internals of @racket[compatible-closure],
as @rtech{compatible-closure-context}, to let us compute the context we want.

@examples[
#:eval cbpv-eval
(define-extended-language cbpvCtxtL cbpvL
  (C ::= (compatible-closure-context v #:wrt e)
     (compatible-closure-context e)
     (compatible-closure-context e #:wrt v)))

(define ->* (context-closure -> cbpvCtxtL C))
(apply-reduction-relation* ->*
  (term (thunk (λ (x) (return (thunk (λ (x) (force (thunk (return x))))))))))
(apply-reduction-relation* ->*
  (term (λ (x) (return (thunk (λ (x) (force (thunk (return x)))))))))
